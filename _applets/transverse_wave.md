To move the left end of the string up and down, click or click and drag in
the window. A wave will travel through the string and will reflect at both
ends.  In this simulation, the right end is fixed.  Using reflection, try
and observe two waves moving through each other. After some practice, it
is possible to create standing waves in the string.  To reset the string,
press the spacebar.
