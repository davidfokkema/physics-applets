You can interact with these applets by clicking and/or dragging the left
end of the string.  Don't worry, clicking *near* the end should be
sufficient.  If you click above or below the string, the left end will
jump to that position.

* [Waves in a string (reflection at fixed end)](applets/transverse_wave/web-export/)
* [AM modulation](applets/AM_modulation/web-export/)
* [FM modulation](applets/FM_modulation/web-export/)
